tomso: TOols for Modelling Stars and Oscillations
=================================================

tomso is a Python module mainly for loading, saving and manipulating
input and output of data for and from stellar evolution and
oscillation codes.

A major objective of this package is minimal dependencies.  I have
tried to make NumPy the only non-standard package that is required.
